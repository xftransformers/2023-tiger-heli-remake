# Tiger Heli Remake
A top-down, vertical-scroller shooter inspired by tiger heli, and a level editor for creating background tiles

## Controls (Game):
- W: move forward
- S: move backwards
- A: move left
- D: move right
- Click (any): shoot bullet, in direction of mouse from helicopter
- Space: deploy bombs
- Escape: exit

## Controls (Level Editor):
- Q/E or scroll wheel: cycle through tiles in current tile set
- Z/C: cycle through tile sets
- R: rotate sprite
- T: toggle placing tank
- M: toggle placing medpack
- Right mouse button: remove most recently placed sprite in current grid square
- Middle mouse button: save current background tile.
  - This will produce a .json file in the 'backgrounds' directory, and a .png file in 
the 'images/background' directory.  Both will have a corresponding UUID for filename
